        <div class="section">
            <p>Suvojeet Sengupta ("I," "me," or "my") built the NoteNext app as an Open Source app. This Privacy Policy
                is used to inform you regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal
                information if anyone decided to use my Service.</p>
            <p>By using NoteNext, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The
                information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your
                information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>NoteNext is designed with your privacy as a top priority. All of your data, including your notes,
                checklists, images, and settings, is stored locally on your device and is not uploaded to any external
                servers.</p>

            <h3>a. Information You Provide</h3>
            <p>We collect the content you create and store within the app, which includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notes (titles and content)</li>
                <li>Checklists</li>
                <li>Labels</li>
                <li>Projects</li>
                <li>Reminders</li>
                <li>Attachments such as images and other files you add to your notes.</li>
                <li>Settings, including your theme preferences and app lock PIN (stored securely).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data resides solely on your device.</p>

            <h3>b. Permissions</h3>
            <p>NoteNext requests certain permissions to enable its features. All permissions are used only for the
                stated purpose within the app's functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / READ_MEDIA_IMAGES:</strong> To allow you to attach images and other
                    files from your device's storage to your notes.</li>
                <li><strong>INTERNET & ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> To fetch link previews, download Google Fonts, and
                    perform Google Drive backups (if enabled).</li>
                <li><strong>USE_BIOMETRIC:</strong> To enable the App Lock feature, allowing you to secure the app with
                    your fingerprint or other biometric credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM & USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT:</strong> To set and display precise reminders
                    that you create for your notes.</li>
                <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> To show notifications for your reminders.</li>
                <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE & FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC:</strong> To ensure reliable data backups
                    to Google Drive, preventing the system from interrupting the upload process during long-running
                    operations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is used exclusively to provide and enhance your experience with NoteNext. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing, displaying, and organizing your notes and other content.</li>
                <li>Enabling features like reminders, app lock, and rich link previews.</li>
                <li>Personalizing your experience through themes and layout settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Backup:</strong> If you choose to use the Google Drive Backup feature, your data is
                    securely zipped and uploaded to your personal Google Drive account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>All data processing occurs locally on your device, unless you explicitly choose to backup your
                    data to Google Drive.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Google Drive Backup</h2>
            <p>NoteNext offers an optional feature to backup your notes to Google Drive. If you choose to use this
                feature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> You will be asked to sign in with your Google account.</li>
                <li><strong>Restricted Access:</strong> The app requests access <em>only</em> to the files it creates
                    (using the <code>drive.file</code> and <code>drive.appdata</code> scopes). It cannot read or access
                    any other files in your Google Drive.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Your notes and attachments are compressed into a standard zip file
                    and uploaded directly to your Google Drive. We do not have access to this data, nor is it sent to
                    any third-party servers other than your own Google Drive storage.</li>
                <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You have full control to link or unlink your account and delete your
                    backups at any time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>I do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties. Since all your
                data is stored locally on your device (or in your personal Google Drive if backup is enabled), I do not
                have access to it. The only exception is when you voluntary choose to share a note using the app's
                "Share" functionality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>NoteNext uses a few third-party libraries to provide its features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Drive API:</strong> Used strictly for the optional backup and restore functionality.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> To provide a better visual experience, the app may download fonts
                    from Google Fonts.</li>
                <li><strong>Jsoup:</strong> To generate rich link previews, the app makes a network request to the URL
                    you provide in a note.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These services have their own privacy policies, and I encourage you to review them. NoteNext does not
                send any of your personal note content to these services (except for the user-initiated Google Drive
                backup).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Data Security, Retention, and Deletion</h2>
            <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information. I have implemented the following measures
                to protect it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your note data is stored in a private, local database on your
                    device.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Backup:</strong> Cloud backups are stored in your personal Google Drive, protected by
                    your Google Account credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>App Lock:</strong> You can enable an additional layer of security by setting up a PIN or
                    using biometric authentication to protect access to the app.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your data is retained on your device for as long as you use the app. You can delete notes at any time,
                which moves them to the Bin. Uninstalling the app will also delete all of its local data. You can
                manually delete your Google Drive backups through the app settings or via Google Drive directly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>NoteNext does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you
                are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information,
                please contact me so that I will be able to take necessary actions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

                for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These
                changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
