# Security & Privacy

NoteNext is built with a "Privacy-First" philosophy.

## 🔒 Biometric App Lock

Secure your notes from prying eyes using your device's built-in security.
- **Integration**: Works with Fingerprint, Face Unlock, or Device PIN/Pattern.
- **Enable**: Go to **Settings > Security** and toggle **App Lock**.
- **Behavior**: When enabled, the app asks for authentication every time it is launched.

## 🛡️ Privacy Principles

1.  **Offline First**: No internet required. Your notes are stored in a local SQLite database on your device.
2.  **No Tracking**: NoteNext contains zero analytics, trackers, or ads. We do not know how you use the app or what you write.
3.  **Encrypted Backups**: Backups sent to Google Drive use your account's security.

## 👁️ Note Locking

You can also lock individual notes for an extra layer of security.
- **Locking**: Long-press a note or open the menu inside a note and select "Lock".
- **Access**: Locked notes hide their content in the preview. Viewing them requires biometric authentication.
