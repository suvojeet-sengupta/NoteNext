# Backup & Restore

Data safety is a priority in NoteNext. We offer robust options to secure your data and move it between devices.

## ☁️ Google Drive Backup

NoteNext allows you to back up your encrypted data directly to your own Google Drive.
- **Why Google Drive?**: It keeps your data under your control. We do not have our own servers; your data lives where you live.
- **Sync**: Perform manual backups to upload your current database.
- **Restore**: Restore from a previous Google Drive backup to retrieve lost notes or migrate to a new device.

### Setup
1. Go to **Settings > Backup & Restore**.
2. Tap **Sign in with Google**.
3. Once authenticated, tap **Backup Now**.

## 💾 Local Backup

Create a physical backup file (`.zip`) on your device's storage.
- **Export**: Generates a ZIP file containing your notes and database.
- **Import**: Restore from a previously exported ZIP file.
- **Use Case**: Useful for manual archiving or transferring data via USB/File Share without cloud access.
