# Organization

NoteNext provides powerful tools to keep your notes structured and easy to find.

## 🏷️ Labels

Labels act as tags for your notes.
- **Create**: Add custom labels (e.g., "Work", "Ideas", "Personal").
- **Filter**: Tap on a label in the sidebar or filter menu to see only notes with that label.
- **Multi-Label**: A note can have one primary label (currently), simplifying categorization.

## 📁 Projects

Projects are high-level containers for related notes.
- **Move to Project**: select notes and move them into a specific project folder.
- **Project View**: View all notes belonging to a specific project in a dedicated screen.

## 📌 Pinning & Archiving

- **Pinning**: Pin important notes to the top of the grid. They will always be visible first, regardless of sorting.
- **Archiving**: Hide notes from the main view without deleting them. Accessed via the "Archive" folder in the menu. Useful for completed projects or old information you want to keep.

## 🔍 Search & Sort

- **Global Search**: Search through titles and content of all your notes instantly.
- **Sorting**: Order your notes by:
    - Date Modified (Default)
    - Date Created
    - Alphabetical (A-Z)
    - Color

## 🎨 Layouts

Customize how you view your notes:
- **Staggered Grid**: Pinterest-style layout that optimizes space for notes of varying lengths.
- **List View**: Standard vertical list for a more compact, linear view.
