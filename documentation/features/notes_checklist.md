# Notes & Checklists

The core of NoteNext is the ability to capture thoughts quickly and effectively.

## 📝 Creating Notes

Tap the **+** (Plus) Floating Action Button (FAB) on the home screen to create a new note. You can choose between:
- **Text Note**: For general writing, essays, or journals.
- **Checklist**: For tasks, to-do lists, and shopping lists.

## ✨ Rich Text Formatting

NoteNext supports Markdown-style rich text formatting. You can format your text using the toolbar or standard shortcuts:
- **Bold**: Make text stand out.
- **Italic**: Emphasize text.
- **Underline**: Highlight key points.
- **Headings**: Structure your note with H1, H2, H3 styles.
- **Links**: URLs are automatically detected and clickable.

## ✅ Checklists

Checklists are designed for productivity:
- **Add Items**: Quickly add new items to the list.
- **Reorder**: Drag and drop items to prioritize them.
- **Completion**: Tap the checkbox to mark an item as done. Completed items move to the bottom automatically (if configured).
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars show your completion rate.

## 📎 Attachments & Media

Make your notes richer by adding media:
- **Images**: Attach photos from your gallery.
- **Voice Notes**: Record audio directly into a note.
- **Link Previews**: Paste a URL, and NoteNext will generate a rich preview card with the title, description, and image of the website.

## 🗑️ Bin (Trash)

Deleted notes are moved to the **Bin** instead of being permanently removed immediately.
- **Recovery**: Restore accidentally deleted notes.
- **Auto-Delete**: Notes in the Bin are automatically deleted after **7 days** (configurable in Settings).
- **Empty Bin**: You can manually empty the bin to permanently delete all items at once.
