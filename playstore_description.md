**Key Features:**

📝 **Powerful Note Editor:**
Go beyond plain text. With our rich text editor, you can format your notes with **bold**, *italics*, and <u>underline</u>, or structure them with different heading styles. Create checklists to keep track of your tasks and to-dos.

🎨 **Personalize & Organize:**
- **Color Your Notes:** Assign colors to your notes for quick visual identification.
- **Labels:** Use labels to categorize your notes and find them easily.
- **Projects:** Group related notes into projects for a new level of organization.
- **Pinning:** Keep your most important notes at the top of the list.

⏰ **Reminders:**
Never miss a deadline or an important event. Set one-time or recurring reminders (daily, weekly, monthly) for your notes, and NoteNext will notify you right on time.

🔒 **Privacy First (App Lock):**
Your privacy is non-negotiable. NoteNext stores all your data locally on your device. For an extra layer of security, you can enable App Lock to protect your notes with a secure PIN or your device's biometric (fingerprint) authentication.

🔗 **Rich Link Previews:**
Add links to your notes and see them come to life with automatic, rich previews that show the title, description, and a thumbnail image. This feature is optional and can be disabled in the settings.

🖼️ **Attachments:**
A picture is worth a thousand words. Add images directly to your notes to capture visual ideas, memories, or information.

📤 **Export & Share:**
Your notes are yours to take anywhere. Export them as TXT or PDF files to your device's "Documents" folder, or share them instantly with friends, family, or other apps using the native Android share functionality.

🌗 **Customizable Experience:**
- **Themes:** Choose between a Light, Dark, or System default theme to match your style.
- **Shape Styles:** Customize the look and feel of the app with different component shape families.

**Built for Privacy:**

We believe your personal notes should be just that: personal.
- **100% Offline:** All your data lives and dies on your device.
- **No Accounts, No Sign-ups:** Just open the app and start writing.
- **Minimal Permissions:** We only ask for permissions that are essential for app features, like setting alarms for reminders or accessing storage for attachments. The `INTERNET` permission is used *only* to fetch optional link previews and download fonts for better typography. It is never used to upload your data.

Whether you're jotting down a quick idea, creating a detailed checklist for a project, or saving important information, NoteNext is the perfect companion for a focused and private note-taking experience.
